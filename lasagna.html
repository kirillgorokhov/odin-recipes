    <h1>Magnificent White Lasagna</h1>

    <h2><i>Description</i></h2>
    <div>
        <p>If creamy pasta makes you weak in the knees, white lasagna is going to be right up your alley. You’ve got to try it! Unlike lasagnas made with marinara, you won’t find a drop of red sauce in sight. Here you’ll find layers of hearty pasta, ricotta, mozzarella, Italian sausage crumbles, and an entire pound of fresh spinach. But what makes white lasagna so special and totally irresistible is the impossibly creamy white sauce that’s blanketed throughout the casserole. Ready to get cooking?</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can artichokes in water, drained</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried basil, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken, artichokes, shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese, milk, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic powder together in a bowl until smooth. Mix 2/3 of the cream cheese mixture with the chicken mixture. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Spread a single layer of lasagna noodles over the cream cheese mixture, top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture, and a layer of mozzarella cheese slices. Repeat layering with noodles, chicken mixture, and mozzarella slices 2 times. Top with remaining Parmesan cheese and basil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
